This code presents a GraphQL schema for PDF analysis feature in Ollama AI. It includes the `Document` type, along with an `AnalysisResult` type for the extracted data.

Also included is a `Query` type that defines two possible API endpoints: retrieve a document by ID and analyze an uploaded PDF file.

Please note that this code already matches the project's结构 if you provide additional resolvers or types as needed.
