For the record I have no clue what i'm doing!
Extremely new and probably broken lol

### Multi-Agent Software Generation System

**Project Codename:** The Agency

**Objective:** Build an open-source, boundary-pushing AI agent system that can autonomously generate, test, and deploy complete software solutions across web, CLI, full-stack, and ML domains.

### Phase 1 File Count: ~15 Core Files

- Modular, extendable, and plug-in friendly.
- Full control over which model (local or GPT-4) handles each task.

# 🧠 The Agency

The Agency is an autonomous AI system designed to write, test, debug, review, and deploy software solutions entirely on its own. Built for developers, makers, tinkerers, and the terminally curious, The Agency transforms prompts into production-ready code.

## 🚨 What Makes It Different?

The Agency combines multiple specialized AI agents:
- 🧱 **ArchitectAgent**: Breaks down your idea into structured files and tech stacks
- ✍️ **CoderAgent**: Writes working code using open-source models (Qwen, Codestral via Ollama)
- 🧪 **TesterAgent**: Executes the code, runs unit tests, captures logs
- 👁️ **ReviewerAgent**: Uses GPT-4 to provide high-quality QA feedback
- 🔧 **FixerAgent**: Repairs broken or low-quality code
- 🚀 **DeployerAgent**: Packages the project into a Docker container and runs it

All while using:
- 🧠 MySQL-based persistent memory
- 🗂️ A modular architecture for future agent extensions
- 🛡️ Open-source LLMs for code generation, GPT-4 for critical review

## 🧰 Use Cases
- Generate full-stack web apps from a description
- Spin up FastAPI+React dashboards with auth
- Auto-patch broken scripts from test results
- Write & run ML pipelines
- Build deployment pipelines on autopilot

## 💽 Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Docker (for deployment/testing)
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 review agent)
- Optional: Ollama running Qwen2 or Codestral models

## 🔌 Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/meistro57/The-Agency.git
cd The-Agency
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧠 Configuration
Edit `config.py` or use environment variables:
```bash
export GPT4_API_KEY=your-key
export OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen:latest
export MYSQL_USER=agency
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=agency123
```

## 🧪 Run via Terminal
```bash
python interfaces/cli_interface.py
```

## 🧪 Workflow
1. Accepts prompt from user (chat or file)
2. Architect breaks into structured blueprint
3. Coder generates complete files
4. Tester runs everything
5. Reviewer (GPT-4) gives feedback
6. Fixer loops back and patches
7. If all checks pass, Deployer ships it in Docker

## 🔮 Future Features
- Web interface for drag-and-drop blueprints
- Agent marketplace (plug in your own agents)
- GitHub auto-push + CI/CD integration
- Plugin-based extension architecture
- Fine-tuned retrieval systems and documentation integration

## 🧠 Philosophy
"Tell it what you need and it will do the rest."

Built to replace the drudgework. Built to experiment faster. Built to make makers unstoppable.
```

Let the build commence. ☕
