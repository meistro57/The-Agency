**Project Blueprint: The Agency (Rev 2.5)**

---

**1. Mission & Purpose**

* Develop a decentralized, multi-agent AI system focused on real-world utility, autonomous task execution, and ethical resilience.
* Target applications: software engineering, scientific research, automation, and multimedia generation.
* Design for modularity, developer extensibility, and long-term maintainability.

---

**2. System Architecture**

**2.1 Agent Kernel**

* **Skill Layer:** Modular Python functions (e.g., `scrape_site()`, `query_api()`, `generate_image(prompt)`) loaded via plugin system.
* **Memory Layer:** Fast-access working memory (in-RAM dicts), persistent symbolic memory (MySQL), semantic memory (FAISS).
* **Execution Engine:** Event-driven task loop with context switching and structured retry logic.
* **Ethical Guardrails:** Decorators (e.g., `@requires_ethics_check`) and runtime hooks block disallowed actions. Hooks register at kernel init; use dynamic imports and tracing to enforce constraints.

**2.2 Meta-Agent Layer**

* Coordinates agents, handles arbitration, and mission orchestration.
* Uses priority queues + entropy-based analysis to detect overloaded/deadlocked agents.
* Replanning triggers: failed tasks, elevated conflict frequency, time-to-completion anomalies.

**2.3 Message Bus**

* Redis Pub/Sub default with optional MQTT or gRPC.
* Messages use JSON schema, signed and encrypted (TLS 1.3 + HMAC). Schema validated via `pydantic`.

**2.4 Deployment Modes**

* **Local Mode:** SQLite fallback, minimal runtime.
* **LAN Mode:** MySQL + shared mount point (e.g., NFS). Agents use `hostname`-based node identity.
* **Hybrid Mode:** Cloud-mirrored MySQL/FAISS (read-only unless override). Cloud target TBD (S3-compatible).

---

**3. Intelligence & Learning**

**3.1 Self-Improvement Loop**

* Log review agents score outcomes by metrics: success flag, time-to-completion, log quality, I/O relevance.
* Spawn request if failures exceed adaptive threshold or capability gap detected.

**3.2 Adaptive Skill Management**

* Uses LM Studio/Ollama for local codegen.
* Lint via `ruff`; failure blocks deployment.
* Manual fallback if model generation fails.

**3.3 Memory Dynamics**

* Semantic memory uses cosine distance with recency weighting (e.g., `score = cos_sim * exp(-delta_t / T)`).
* Symbolic/semantic delta compared per mission tag to detect decay or conflicts.

---

**4. Mission System**

**4.1 Mission Dispatcher**

* Accepts structured JSON objectives (e.g., `{goal: "extract data", target: URL, deadline: time}`).
* Breaks into sub-missions and assigns based on skill affinity + availability.

**4.2 Priority Scoring**

* Factors: urgency, ethical risk, novelty, estimated impact, resource footprint.
* Scores are tunable per org profile or user config.

**4.3 Strategic Planning Agent**

* Builds scenario trees using agent model registry.
* Plugins allow domain-specific forecasting (e.g., for ML pipelines, research workflows).

---

**5. Oversight & Safeguards**

**5.1 Lightweight Ethical Kernel**

* Guardrails wrap sensitive I/O, eval, subprocess calls.
* Hook registry loads pre-runtime; decorators check agent context before function execution.

**5.2 Drift Monitor**

* Monitors entropy of message payloads and output token distributions.
* Spike detection via z-score and rolling average deviation. Alerts escalate to dashboard.

**5.3 Sandboxing & Simulation**

* Docker containers run experimental agents.
* Output feeds replay system; triggers rollback if anomaly detected (e.g., high output variance, forbidden API call).

**5.4 Escalation & HITL**

* Flask dashboard exposes:

  * Agent health/status
  * Kill switch
  * Annotated logs
  * Override panel for mission reassignment

---

**6. Infrastructure & Operations**

**6.1 Resource Controller**

* Uses `psutil` and internal metrics to monitor agent footprint.
* Scheduler applies load-balancing based on task complexity and node pressure.

**6.2 Security Layer**

* TLS 1.3, API key rotation every 24h.
* Agent whitelisting via signed config manifest.

**6.3 Snapshot System**

* Git-style snapshot diffs using `dolt` (MySQL) and JSON manifest tracking.
* Snapshot every 6h or post-mission.

---

**7. Developer Experience**

**7.1 Dev Portal**

* Web UI with:

  * Plugin registry
  * Agent builder
  * Mission scripting DSL (`jsonnet`-like syntax)

**7.2 CI/CD Integration**

* GitHub Actions for unit + semantic regression tests.
* Deployment pipeline to `staging` branch for dry-runs.

---

**8. Interoperability**

* Adapters for:

  * OpenAI (v1+), HuggingFace, LM Studio
  * LangChain agents, ComfyUI workflows
  * ggml/gguf models (local LLMs)

---

**9. Governance & Open Source**

* AGPL license.
* Community voting for RFCs.
* Maintainers review plugin PRs via trust scores and audit results.

---

**10. Future Horizons**

* BCI input interface (for neuro-adaptive agents)
* Federated memory sync
* Quantum co-processor simulation pool
* Autonomous swarm orchestration

---

**11. Roadmap (Q2-Q3)**

* **Q2:** MVP agent kernel, local deployment, Redis bus, mission dispatcher.
* **Q3:** LAN mode, dashboard v2, adaptive spawning, skill plugin SDK.

---

**12. Summary**
*The Agency v2.5 marks a production-capable architecture with a clear implementation path. It balances structure, safety, and scalability while leaving room for emergent complexity.*
